# 🧭 MargDarshak AI

**MargDarshak AI** is a **Generative AI–powered travel planning assistant** that creates personalized, budget-aware, and route-optimized travel plans. It uses Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt engineering, and optional tool integrations to guide users step by step — from planning routes to finding food, medical facilities, stays, and rentals.

This project focuses on **real-world GenAI concepts** such as memory, reasoning, personalization, and multi-step response generation.
